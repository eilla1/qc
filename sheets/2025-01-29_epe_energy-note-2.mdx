Greenhouse gas emissions are strongly correlated with energy usage as the primary source of these emissions is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation. The EPA analyzed emissions in the US by breaking down sources into economic sectors including transportation, electricity production, industry, commercial/residential, agriculture, and land use/forestry. The transportation sector was found to be the chief emitter of greenhouse gases with industry and electric power production following close behind. When accounting for electricity distributed to their respective end-use sectors, commercial and residential activities account for the largest share.

### Is industry the chief energy villain?

According to data from the EPA, industry accounts for 30% of greenhouse gas emissions while transportation and residential/commercial sectors contribute a fairly similar share at 29% and 31% respectively. Based on this data, it would be incorrect to label industry as the chief energy villain. Aside from the data, industry itself may not be to blame as the chief energy villain. In the case of fast fashion (cheaply produced and priced garments that cause harm to the environment and society), the industry is largely driven by the market. If consumers simply reduced their demand for fast fashion, perhaps production of goods would be reduced and consequently use less energy.
